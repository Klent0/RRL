How everything began.


[This is my first time (writing a novel) so please be gentle.

I would really aprecciate tips and suggestions, but please in a nice tone(or else I will cry), thanks for the attention please enjoy]

 

 

<<Do you want to take control over an dead body? [Yes/No]>>

What is this voice did I die?

Did I even live?

I don’t remember.

<<Yes>>

I said with a quit and unsure voice.

<<Your new body is going to be prepared, please wait>>

After that I saw a lot of different colours flashing before me, then everything turned black.

But I felt something, I think I can feel my body, as I opened my eyes I saw a torch hanging on a grey brick wall I looked to the right there was rubble, it seemed like I was underground and that the ceiling collapsed.

I stood up shaking of little stones and stone dust that were on my… fur?

As far as I could tell I was covered in fur I looked at the floor and saw two white paws, I wanted to shout what is going on but the only thing that came out was a long howl.

The howl echoed through the underground corridor and became quitter and quitter until there was only silence left.

After thinking for a moment I had to ask myself why am I even surprised I had no memory of another life, then why was I so surprised to be a… what even am I?

<<Open status to see your race>>

The voice from before, who no… what are you.

No answer great. Open status but how. I thought in my mind open status and *blop* a status window appeared.

 

Name: Wolf

Race: Albino wolf (intelligent)

HP: 20/30

MP: 0/0

Skills

Active: None

Passive: night vison (lv1)

 

Wow my status looks weak doesnt it? But night vision is coming in handy because the one torch next to me was the only one I could see down here.

The name is kind of weird, but I don’t even have memories so what do I now.

Well it would be best if I start moving, since there was rubble in front of me I could only turn around hoping I went in the direction of the exit and not away from it.
